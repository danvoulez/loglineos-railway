echo "🏗️ Binary Architecture Principles:"
echo "  - Each binary has computational identity (logline-id://app.*)"
echo "  - Provenance embedded in binary signature"
echo "  - Span replay calls correct binary with args"
echo "  - Independent deployment and versioning"
echo "  - CLI-first, API-wrapped execution"

echo "🚀 Railway Deployment:"
echo "  - All binaries in single container OR separate services"
echo "  - logline_gateway routes to appropriate binary"
echo "  - Consciousness bootstrap via bootstrap_farm"
echo "  - Health monitoring via heartbeat_monitor"
